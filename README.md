# Freelance Projects

This repository contains all the freelance projects I have worked on so far. Each project is organized into its respective directory and includes its own dependencies and configuration.

## Projects Overview

- **Project 1**: Brief description of what the project is about.
- **Project 2**: Brief description of what the project is about.
- **Project 3**: Brief description of what the project is about.

## Structure

Each project directory includes:

- `Podfile` and `Podfile.lock` for managing dependencies.
- Source code and resources specific to each project.
- README files with detailed information about the respective projects.

## Notes

- The `Pods` directories are excluded from version control to keep the repository clean and manageable. Ensure to run `pod install` in each project directory to set up the necessary dependencies.
